# Presentation
Welcome to this blog. It pretends to be a "live" record of my experimentations with [Python](https://www.python.org/) code in general, and its use in economic research in particular. I hope it will allow me:

* To discipline myself into writing my ideas.
* To share some of my interests with potential readers.
* To learn to code and to use code better.

Let's see how far can we go with this little [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) thing! To $\infty$ and beyond!
